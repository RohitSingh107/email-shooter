Application for SDE Functional Programming - Rohit Singh

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am thrilled to express my strong interest in the SDE Functional Programming position at Juspay. As a dedicated Computer Science undergraduate, I am eager to bring my passion for emerging technologies and proficiency in Functional Programming to contribute to your team.

From the early stages of my programming journey, I have been captivated by the elegance and aesthetics of Functional Programming, embracing features such as immutability, statelessness, declarative paradigm, pure functions, and higher-order functions. I have experience working with Haskell and some familiarity with Purescript, Elixir, and incorporating Functional Programming principles into Python using modules like functools and itertools.

Discovering Juspay's alignment with my passion and love for functional programming resonated deeply with me. I distinctly felt a resounding "YES, THIS IS MY DREAM COMPANY" from within.

As a Software Developer Intern at AppAvengers Labs, I honed my skills in web backend development and cutting-edge technologies. My projects involved crafting Bitcoin wallets in Rust, engineering smart contracts for Ethereum and Solana blockchains, and developing backends and REST APIs using Haskell IHP, Django, and FastAPI. I delved into web3 technologies, including ZK Proofs, Roll-ups, and SDKs.

Proficient in Haskell, Python, Rust, Typescript, and C++, I've successfully executed projects spanning API development to deployment. My expertise extends to databases, particularly PostgreSQL and MongoDB. I boast a strong foundation in data structures and algorithms, highlighted by my JavaScript library focused on calculus algorithms.

A commitment to continuous learning and exploration of new technologies, coupled with a preference for test-driven development, ensures the creation of robust and reliable code. My ability to generate comprehensive technical documentation further underscores my dedication to quality work.

Being an active member of the Garuda Linux open-source project showcases my collaborative and proactive approach to contributing to meaningful endeavors.

In conclusion, I am confident that my technical proficiency, proactive mindset, and commitment to positive impact align seamlessly with your team's goals and values. I look forward to discussing how I can contribute meaningfully to Juspay.

Thank you for considering my application. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to discuss my potential contributions further.

Sincerely,
Rohit Singh
